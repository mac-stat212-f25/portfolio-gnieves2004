Using both the small thumbnail visuals on the right and the names of the geom’s, brainstorm some possibilities for geom’s you might use to recreate the temperature visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigating Documentation / Reference Pages\n\n\n\nYou need to navigate the geoms further by opening up their reference pages to understand if a particular geom is suitable for our task. Let’s look at the geom_point documentation page to learn how to read a documentation page..\nThe Usage section shows all of the possible inputs (arguments) to the geom. These are all of the ways that a geom can be customized. Just looking at the argument names can help give a hint as to what arguments might fit our needs.\nThe Arguments section, on the other hand, explains in detail what each argument does and the possible values the argument can take. The mapping, data, and ... arguments will be the most commonly used by far.\n\n\nmapping is the argument that is being used when we specify which variables should link or map to the plot aesthetics (the code inside aes()).\n\ndata is the argument where we specify the dataset containing the variables that the geom is using.\n\n... is used for fixed aesthetics (ones that don’t correspond to a variable), eg, to set the color of all points, we use color = \"red\" and to set the size of all points, we use size = 3.\n\nThe Aesthetics section of a geom documentation page gives information on how the visual elements of the geom correspond to data. For example, the geom_point documentation page shows that x and y aesthetics are available. It also shows some new aesthetics like stroke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata Argument\n\n\n\nPreviously you have used one dataset per plot by specifying that as the first argument of ggplot(). However, multiple data sets can be passed into ggplot as shown in the example below.\n\nCodedata(diamonds)\n\ndiamonds_avg_price &lt;- diamonds |&gt;\n  group_by(carat) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_price = mean(price)) |&gt;\n  arrange(carat)\ndiamonds_avg_price &lt;- diamonds_avg_price[seq(1, nrow(diamonds_avg_price), 3), ]\n\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = diamonds_avg_price,\n    aes(x = carat, y = avg_price),\n    color = \"deepskyblue\",\n    size = 3\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the geom_linerange documentation page and start off your temperature visualization with the record lows and highs. Your plot should look like the one below. The hex code of the used light tan color is #ECEBE3.\n\n\nSFO Weather Records in 2011\n\n\nCodeggplot(aes(x = dateInYear), data = weather) +\n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = RecordLow, ymax = RecordHigh), fill = \"#ECEBE3\") +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\n\n\nAs you work on this plot, try to use some new keyboard shortcuts. Focus on the following:\n\nInsert code chunk: Ctrl+Alt+I (Windows). Option+Command+I (Mac).\nRun current code chunk: Ctrl+Shift+Enter (Windows). Command+Shift+Return (Mac).\nRun current line/currently selected lines: Ctrl+Enter (Windows). Command+Return (Mac).",

RStudio will create a template app when you go to File –&gt; New File –&gt; Shiny Web App then enter/select the following values:\n\nfor the Application name, type neighborhood_diversity.\nfor Application type, leave the default option Single file (app.R)\n\n\nThis creates a folder in your current directory called neighborhood_diversity with a single R code file called app.R.\nClick the Run App button in the top right of the source code editor to view the app in action.\nThe app.R has three components:\n\na user interface object (ui): to set up the layout of the app\na server function (server): to define how the app will react to user input\na call to the shinyApp() function: to launch the app using the UI object (ui) and server function (server) created above\nGetting Acquainted\nSetup part 1: Load required packages at the top of app.R: shiny, tidyverse, sf, and plotly.\nSetup part 2: Data download and folder setup\nSave the two files, diverse_data_by_dist.rds and diverse_data_by_year.csv, with the folder setup below inside your portfolio repository.\n\n📂 neighborhood_diversity\n\napp.R\n📂 data\n\ndiverse_data_by_dist.rds\ndiverse_data_by_year.csv\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup part 3: Below your library() calls, add the following commands to read in the data:\n\nCodedata_by_dist &lt;- read_rds(\"../../neighborhood_diversity/data/diverse_data_by_dist.rds\")\ndata_by_year &lt;- read_csv(\"../../neighborhood_diversity/data/diverse_data_by_year.csv\")\nmetro_names &lt;- data_by_dist |&gt; pull(metro_name) |&gt; unique()\n\nmetro_names\n\n\nGetting acquainted with the app and underlying code: Take a few minutes to explore the code:\n\n\nui section. How are functions nested inside each other, and how does this seem to relate to the visual appearance of the app?\nWhat names/labels in the User Interface (ui) part of the app seem to be shared with the server part of the app?\nData Codebook\nThe data_by_dist dataset is an sf object (cases = census tracts) with the following variables:\n\n\nmetro_id: numeric ID for the city\n\nmetro_name: city name\n\ngeometry: information about the spatial geometry for the tract\n\ntract_id: numeric census tract ID\n\ndistmiles: distance in miles from this tract to city hall\n\nentropy: a measure of the diversity of a census tract (a diversity “score”)\nRace variables (each of these is the number of people)\n\n\naian: American Indian\nasian\nblack\nhispanic\ntwo_or_more\nwhite\n\n\n\nThe data_by_year dataset has a subset of the above variables as well as a year variable.\n\n*Input() functions\nWhat do these do? The *Input() functions collect inputs from the user.\nWhere are these functions on the cheatsheet? Right-hand side of the first page\nWhere do these go in the app?\n\nAll *Input() functions go in the ui part of the app.\nPay careful attention to the nesting of the functions in the ui section. For example, in a sidebarLayout(), these *Input() functions should go in the sidebarPanel() (as opposed to the mainPanel()).\nSeparate multiple *Input() functions with commas.\n\nHow do the function arguments work? In all the *Input() functions, the first two arguments are the same:\n\n\ninputId is how you will refer to this input in the server portion later. You can call this anything you want, but make this ID describe the information that the user is providing.\n\nlabel is how this will actually be labeled in your UI (what text shows up in the app).\n\nEach function has some additional arguments depending what you want to do.\nYour Turn\nAdd the following two user inputs to your app:\n\nDropdown to select the city name\nSlider to choose the span parameter for the scatterplot smooth\n\nThis parameter varies from 0 to 1. Lower values result in a wiggly smoothing line, and higher values result in a smoother line.\n\n\n\nUse the Shiny cheatsheet to find the *Input() functions that correspond to the two inputs above. Add them to the appropriate place within the ui object. Use commas to separate the inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParentheses Pandemonium\n\n\n\nCarefully formatting your code will be crucial here! With shiny UIs, it is very easy to lose or mismatch parentheses, which leads to frustrating errors. My suggestion is to place parentheses as follow:\nsliderInput(\n    argument1 = value1,\n    argument2 = value2,\n    argument3 = value3\n)\nNote how the left parenthesis is on the same line as the function, and the right parenthesis is on its own line and left-aligned with the start of the function name.\nTip: In RStudio, you can place your cursor next to any parenthesis to highlight the matching parenthesis (if there is one).\n\n\nYou will have to look at the documentation for the *Input() functions to know how to use arguments beyond inputId and label. To view this documentation, type ?function_name in the Console.\nTo get the collection of city names from the data_by_dist dataset, you can use the following:\nmetro_names &lt;- data_by_dist |&gt; pull(metro_name) |&gt; unique()\nPut this metro_names code just beneath where you read in the data.\nOnce you finish, run your app. Make sure you can select and move things around as expected. You won’t see any plots yet—we’ll work on those in the next exercises.\n\n*Output() functions\nWhat do these do? *Output() functions in the ui portion work with the render*() functions in the server portion to to add R output (like plots and tables) to the UI.\nWhere are these functions on the cheatsheet? Bottom-center of the first page\nWhere do these go in the app?\n\nAll *Output() functions go in the ui part of the app.\nPay careful attention to the nesting of the functions in the ui section. For example, in a sidebarLayout(), these *Output() functions should go in the mainPanel() (as opposed to the sidebarPanel()).\nSeparate multiple *Output() functions with commas.\n\nHow do the function arguments work? In all the *Output() functions, the first argument is the same:\n\n\noutputId works just like inputId for *Input() functions. This is how you will refer to this output in the server portion later. You can call this anything you want, but make this ID describe the output being created.\n\nYour Turn\nAdd 3 outputs to the ui that will eventually be:\n\nA scatterplot of diversity score (entropy) versus distance to city hall (distmiles) with a smoothing line (smoothness controlled by the span parameter on your slider input)\nA map of diversity scores across the counties in the selected city\nA bar chart of the overall race distribution in the selected city (i.e., the total number of people in each race category in the city)\n\nFor now, don’t worry that the layout of the plots exactly matches the original neighborhood diversity app. (You will update this in your homework.)\nRun the app with the output. Notice that nothing really changes. Think of the outputs you just placed as placeholders—the app knows there will be a plot in the UI, but the details of what the plots will look like and the R code to create them will be in the server portion. Let’s talk about that now!\n\nrender*() functions\nWhat do these do? The render*() functions use R code (i.e., standard ggplot code) to communicate with (“listen to”) the user inputs to create the desired output.\nWhere are these functions on the cheatsheet? Bottom-center of the first page. The render*() function you use will depend on the desired output. The bottom center of the cheatsheet shows how *Output() and render*() functions connect.\nWhere do these go in the app? The render*() functions go in the server function of the app.\nIn general, the server section of code will look something like this:\n\nCode# Suppose the following are somewhere in the UI part\n\n\nnumericInput(inputId = \"min_year\")\nnumericInput(inputId = \"max_year\")\nplotOutput(outputId = \"plot_over_years\")\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n    output$plot_over_years &lt;- renderPlot({ # Note the curly braces that enclose the R code below\n        ggplot(...) +\n            scale_x_continuous(limits = c(input$min_year, input$max_year))\n    })\n\n#server function in shiny app for neighborhood diversity\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  output$distPlot &lt;- renderPlotly({ # Note the curly braces that enclose the R code below\n    p &lt;- data_by_dist %&gt;%\n    st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n    filter(metro_name == input$selected_city) %&gt;%\n      ggplot(aes(x = distmiles, y = entropy)) +\n      geom_point() +\n      geom_smooth(method =\"loess\", span = input$selected_span, color = \"red\") +\n      theme_minimal() +\n      labs(x = \"Diversity Score\", y = \"Distance in Miles from City Hall\")\n\n   ggplotly(p)\n  })\n}\n\n\nYour Turn\nWhile our main goals is to make 3 plots, you will just make one of them in this exercise.\nAdd a renderPlot() functions inside the server portion of the code to make the scatterplot of diversity score (entropy) versus distance to city hall (distmiles) with a smoothing line. Use the data_by_dist dataset. Reference the inputs you’ve already created in previous exercises by using filter() and ggplot() to render the desired interactive plot.\nNote: the geom_??? used to create the smoothing line has a span parameter. (Check out the documentation for that geom by entering ?geom_??? in the Console.)\nRun the app and check that the scatterplot displays and reacts to the chosen city and span parameter.\nAs part of Homework 9, you will finish this Shiny app.",

Here, each point is a country, so this makes the animation transition smoothly from year to year for a given country. (For more information, see here.)\n\n\nCodedata(gapminder, package = \"gapminder\")\np &lt;- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, size = pop)) +\n    geom_point(aes(frame = year, ids = country)) +\n    scale_x_log10() +\n    labs(x = \"GDP per capita\", y = \"Life expectancy (years)\", color = \"Continent\", size = \"Population\") +\n    theme_classic()\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Turn\nIn a web application, having plots be plotly objects is just nice by default because of the great mouseover, zoom, and pan features.\nInside app.R, change plotOutput to plotlyOutput and renderPlot to renderPlotly for the scatterplot and the barplot. Make sure to add calls to ggplotly() too.\nAs part of Homework 9, you will incorporate advanced plotly into the Shiny App.",
